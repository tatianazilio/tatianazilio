## What I've Already Worked With

All public projects that you'll find here are quite outdated ~~and not my best work~~. They're from when I was taking the first steps in my coding journey. But they're a good reminder of how we're continually progressing.

After these first steps, I spent 3 years working with:

![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white)

## Reading List

Reading doesn't mean endorsement. Some of the books that are listed here were fundamental for my formation as a software engineer, but it doesn't mean that I abide to their content. Some were good introduction to our industry practices and a good starting point for reflecting on it.
